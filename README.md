# Calculator Project

## Project Objective
This calculator project serves as the capstone to everything I've
learned with HTML, CSS, and Javascript in the Foundations module of TOP.
I practiced using CSS grid and flexbox, as well as Javascript functions
and event listeners to make a real, functioning, simple calculator.

### Future Improvements
* Add a history of the calculation in progress to the top of the display
  screen.
* Clean up the code a little, and find a more elegant solution for the
  current LastEqualsFlag.
* On keydown, do the same functionality as hovering with a mouse.
  (Remove on keyup).
* Add some more functionality, like factorial, square root, mod, squared.
* Mobile friendly
* Add some cool designs to the sides of the screen to make the page more interesting.
